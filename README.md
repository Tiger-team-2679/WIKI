## Repository and File Naming Convention
Repository names should use highercase with hyphens in place of spaces between words.
Programming language source files should use the style dictated by the style guide for that language.

### License 
Every project should contain a file called LICENSE.md containing the project's license (dah...).
The license of the repository must be declared as well in the project's readme file, attached with a link to the LICENSE.md file.

## README Style
readme should always contain a title declared with # as the repositories's name, with spaces instead og hyphens.
also every readme should contain a table of content as in the approche taken at this readme.
